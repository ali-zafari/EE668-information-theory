Consider the given file(James C. Maxwell.docx). Compute the probabilities of alphabet and number (ratio of the number of occurrences to the total count of alphabets and numerals) and create a table with symbols and probabilities. Determine the Huffman code for the symbols and create the table of symbols and Huffman codewords. Using the above constructed table encode your name and Roll number.
